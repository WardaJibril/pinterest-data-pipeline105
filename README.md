# Pinterest Data Streaming

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end **data streaming pipeline** for processing data from key **Pinterest tables**: **pin**, **geo**, and **user**. The pipeline ingests, transforms, and stores this data in a **Delta Table** on **Databricks**, simulating a real-world **data processing** scenario. The primary goal is to showcase how **real-time data streaming** can be integrated with **AWS Kinesis** and **Databricks** for efficient data transformation, storage, and advanced analytics.

### Key Learnings:
- Real-time data ingestion and **data transformation**
- Integration of **AWS Kinesis** with **Databricks** for real-time data pipelines
- **Data cleaning** and processing using **Databricks Notebooks**
- Handling both **batch** and **streaming data sources** efficiently

---

## Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python**: For data extraction and transformation
- **Databricks**: For data processing and storing data in **Delta Tables**
- **AWS Kinesis**: Real-time **data streaming** service for ingesting data
- **AWS S3**: **Cloud storage** used for batch data handling
- **Boto3**: AWS SDK for Python to interact with **AWS services**
- **Kafka REST Proxy**: To send data to **Kafka topics** for stream processing

## Pipeline Workflow

### Data Sources
The pipeline processes data from the following Pinterest tables:
- **Pin Data**: Information about user-pinned content
- **Geolocation Data**: Data related to user locations
- **User Data**: User details and activities on Pinterest

### Data Extraction
- **REST API** and **AWS SDK (boto3)** are used to interact with **AWS services** and pull data from the above-mentioned tables.
  
### Data Cleaning (ETL)
- The data is cleaned and transformed using **Python** scripts to handle missing data, transform columns, and ensure consistency across all data sources.
  
### Data Loading
- The cleaned data is ingested into **AWS Kinesis streams** and loaded into **Delta Tables** on **Databricks** for further analytics and processing.

## Analytical Insights
Once the data is ingested and processed in **Databricks**, the final dataset is ready for advanced analysis. **SQL queries** can be written on the Delta Tables to derive insights on Pinterest’s user behavior, geolocation data, and pin engagement for better decision-making.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates an efficient and scalable real-time **data streaming pipeline** using industry-standard tools like **AWS**, **Kafka**, and **Databricks**. It’s a great example of how to build cloud-native solutions that handle both **batch** and **streaming data**, providing insights and analytics in real time.
